# face-detection-and-recognition-system
# This face detection and recognition system involves the detection and recognition of human faces in images or videos.
# It involves preprocessing of the images to detect the presence of faces, followed by feature extraction and recognition of the faces using machine learning algorithms.
# The system first identifies the presence of a face in an image or video using Haar cascades.
# Once a face is detected, it is then recognized using facial features such as the eyes, nose, and mouth.
# This is done through algorithms which compare the detected features to a database of known faces.
